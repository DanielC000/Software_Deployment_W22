I used these guides ([1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/template-tutorial-create-first-template?tabs=azure-powershell) | [2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/resource-manager-web-app?tabs=json)) from Microsoft for the creation and deployment of the ARM template. I had some issues during deployment:

>1. Firstly, I had difficulty installing Azure PowerShell so I switched to Azure CLI which installed smothly. 
>2. Most of my trubles came from an "Cannot find ServerFarm with name Lab1ServerFarm" error: 
  >- After searching on the web I realized that I was missing an ServerFarm so I added the creation of a serverFarm to the template.
  >- Took me a while realize that the ServerFarm has to be in the same resource group as the web app.

After fixing these issues I managed to deploy successfully.
